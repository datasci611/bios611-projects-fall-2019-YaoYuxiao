# Background 
It is from a Kaggle Competition. Here is the competition description:
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

# Datasets
Here is the dataset I am planning to use:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. 
It includes:
train.csv - the training set
test.csv - the test set
data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here
sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms
